## Pymaceuticals-Challenge

# In this script you will find the following 

1. A summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.


2. A bar plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the number of data points for each treatment regimen.


3. A pie plot using both Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

4. The final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculated quartiles and IQR and any a listing of any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.


5. Using Matplotlib, a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot.


6. A line plot of time point versus tumor volume for a single mouse treated with Capomulin.


7. A scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen.


8. The correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment. The linear regression model plotted on top of the previous scatter plot.
